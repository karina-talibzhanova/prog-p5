# Peer Reviews

## Review 1
### Usability of Code
* where are the parameters????
* only has getters and setters
    * those could also be put in the constructor as things the user can setup when creating the object in the first place
    * this also means that it has no default values and everything must be manually changed
* getters and setters are good tho
* methinks it is reusable so yay!

### Development of Original
* original was submitted
* definitely in a class
* ......... there are no parameters, only getters and setters
* extra things were added such as roman numerals, date, am/pm stuff so yay


### Quality of Example
* mostly valid, just a few instances of using 'align' when that is now deprecated and CSS should be used instead
* intuitive to use
* form controls are pretty good
    * wish i could individually change the text colours but oh well
    * oh also, clock style and clock colour is the same thing so like...... why?
    * also if like.... could change the colour to anything i want, that would be cool

### Quality of Documentation
* just tells me that there are getters/setters/functions
    * don't know what values to pass for functions. string? int? bool? who knows
* if i knew nothing about p5, i would not be able to use this class with its documentation
* good acknowledgement of source tho and licensing and libraries used and stuff

### Code Quality
* jesus i hate the var foo, bar, etc; thing but like, i get the original person did that. it just seems kinda lazy tho
* mixture of single and double quotes. pick one and stick with it
* comments are okay, wouldn't mind a bit more information but otherwise, i understand what each bit does so
