# Peer Reviews

## Review 1
### Usability of Code
* where are the parameters????
* only has getters and setters
    * those could also be put in the constructor as things the user can setup when creating the object in the first place
    * this also means that it has no default values and everything must be manually changed
* getters and setters are good tho
* methinks it is reusable so yay!

### Development of Original
* original was submitted
* definitely in a class
* ......... there are no parameters, only getters and setters
* extra things were added such as roman numerals, date, am/pm stuff so yay


### Quality of Example
* mostly valid, just a few instances of using 'align' when that is now deprecated and CSS should be used instead
* intuitive to use
* form controls are pretty good
    * wish i could individually change the text colours but oh well
    * oh also, clock style and clock colour is the same thing so like...... why?
    * also if like.... could change the colour to anything i want, that would be cool

### Quality of Documentation
* just tells me that there are getters/setters/functions
    * don't know what values to pass for functions. string? int? bool? who knows
* if i knew nothing about p5, i would not be able to use this class with its documentation
* good acknowledgement of source tho and licensing and libraries used and stuff

### Code Quality
* jesus i hate the var foo, bar, etc; thing but like, i get the original person did that. it just seems kinda lazy tho
* mixture of single and double quotes. pick one and stick with it
* comments are okay, wouldn't mind a bit more information but otherwise, i understand what each bit does so


## Review 2
### Usability of Code
* nice parameters, good constructor and good default values
    * bit annoyed that theta has to be a global variable but everything breaks if it isn't so i guess that's okay?
* problem with setOverdrive tho
    * if user does not have a checkbox, they are restricted to 2 values - 10 or 30
    * don't think it should be dictated by a bool. just let the user set overdrive to whatever they like

### Development of Original
* yes, original was submitted as .js file, and also linked to original sketch in documentation so thanks my dude
* ngl, it wasn't really developed much. like.... scope-wise. it does the same stuff, just now you can fiddle with the values
    * i mean technically, overdrive is a new thing so that's nice
* was translated from processing to p5 javascript so that's good

### Quality of Example
* nice sliders, very good
* except, frequency and wavelength are the wrong way around
* also would be nice to modify 'overdrive' itself (also would prefer if it was renamed to amplitude... since that is what it is)

### Quality of Documentation
* goddamn i love this documentation
* thank you for telling me what type your parameters take i love you so much

### Code Quality
* passed the linter so all good there
* relevant comments so yay
