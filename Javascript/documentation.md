# Documentation of StringWave

StringWave is a JavaScript component that produces a line of text that oscillates with varying amplitudes and frequencies, depending on the user's mouse position.

This component requires the use of p5 libraries which can either be downloaded [here](https://p5js.org/download/) or linked to via the hosted file

* give source of original sketch and acknowledge the license
* explain how the methods work and the parameters and stuff... and like various contexts or whatever
    * like, how pg means you gotta give it a canvas to draw on and it'll do the rest
    * and also how you need function setup() and function draw() and what to put in each
        * show an example of what you want in the docs plus explain what each component does (e.g. the image() function)
* explain the example
    * so like, what sliders do, maybe how they're passed to the setup() and draw() functions?
